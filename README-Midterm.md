## Food Order / Pickup App

This is the midterm project that Samantha Fok, Sahil Sharma, & Ryan Hrechka created from the Oct 26th, 2020 Cohort.
The user can create an order, edit the amounts of that order, or delete them from the order, and submit their order to the 
restaurant, which will get an SMS message to their phone with the order details. The user will then await a response from the 
restaurant, which when sent via SMS, will simutaneously update the webpage with details of when the order will be ready for pickup and send an SMS message containing that information to the client.
